# FolderWriteTime

This program writes a 1024 byte file every 5 seconds. Then it deletes the file again. The time for writing the file is measured and written to the console.

You can specify a parameter that specifies the location of the file. If no parameter is specified, the file is created in the temp directory.

With the help of this program you can check at which times e.g. a network reacts slowly.

Even if the program is maintained a little further, it remains a quick and dirty solution.
